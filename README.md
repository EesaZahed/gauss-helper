A website that gives resources for the Gauss grade 8 math contest.

I completed the 2022 Gauss Grade 8 Contest and earned the Certificate of Distinction (A Certificate of Distinction is provided for each student scoring in the top 25% of all participants within their own school, for schools with at least 4 students registered.)
